# LinkedIn Post: Magic Eden Collection Info CSV Fetcher

🚀 **Just built a powerful NFT data extraction tool for Magic Eden collections!**

As an NFT developer and data enthusiast, I've created the **Magic Eden Collection Info CSV Fetcher** - a robust Node.js tool that extracts comprehensive token data from any Magic Eden collection across multiple EVM chains.

## 🔥 **Key Features:**

✅ **Multi-Chain Support** - Works with Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Sei, BSC, Avalanche, Fantom, and Cronos

✅ **Large Collection Ready** - Handles collections with 10,000+ tokens using smart pagination and offset-based fetching

✅ **Intelligent Rate Limiting** - Built-in 20% safety buffer (400ms delays) to respect Magic Eden's 180 requests/minute limit

✅ **Resilient Error Handling** - Gracefully handles API limits, network issues, and saves partial results if needed

✅ **Rich Data Export** - Extracts rarity ranks, market prices, last sales, attributes, ownership, and more

## 💡 **Perfect For:**

• **NFT Analysts** - Get comprehensive collection data for research and analysis
• **Traders** - Export market data for decision-making tools
• **Developers** - Build applications with clean, structured NFT data
• **Researchers** - Study rarity distributions and market trends

## 🛠 **Technical Highlights:**

• **API Integration** - Uses Magic Eden's v4 EVM API with proper authentication
• **Smart Pagination** - Offset-based fetching prevents data loss on large collections
• **CSV Export** - Timestamped files with 15+ data columns including rarity, market info, and metadata
• **Git Ready** - Properly configured with .gitignore to exclude sensitive data

## 📊 **Real Results:**

Successfully tested on a 3,333-token Sei collection, extracting all data in 34 API requests with zero rate limit issues!

## 🔗 **Open Source:**

The tool is available on GitHub with comprehensive documentation, making it easy for the community to use and contribute.
